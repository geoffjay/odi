# Implementation Plan: Distributed Issue Tracking System

**Branch**: `001-distributed-issue-tracking` | **Date**: 2025-09-28 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `specs/001-distributed-issue-tracking/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → ✅ Loaded: Distributed Issue Tracking System spec
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → ✅ Detect Project Type: single (Rust CLI application with workspace)
   → ✅ Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → ✅ No violations exist
   → ✅ Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → ✅ No NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → Post-Design Constitution Check (will be updated after Phase 1)
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
Build a distributed issue tracking system similar to Git, enabling offline-first collaboration on project issues with distributed synchronization. The system uses Rust with minimal dependencies, Clap for CLI, and a workspace architecture with `odi/` binary and `odi-*` library crates for extensibility.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: Rust 1.75+ (stable channel)
**Primary Dependencies**: clap (CLI), serde (serialization), toml (configuration), tokio (async runtime)
**Storage**: Local filesystem with structured data files (.odi directory)
**Testing**: cargo test with integration and contract test suites
**Target Platform**: Cross-platform (Linux, macOS, Windows) CLI application
**Project Type**: single - Rust workspace with multiple crates
**Performance Goals**: <100ms for local operations, <2s for network operations, <10MB memory usage
**Constraints**: Minimal external dependencies, Git-like UX patterns, offline-first operation
**Scale/Scope**: Support 10,000+ issues per project, 100+ concurrent users, 1MB+ data files

**Structure Decision**: Selected Rust workspace architecture with binary crate (`odi/`) and multiple library crates (`odi-*/`) to enable future extensibility while maintaining clean separation of concerns. This supports the requirement for consumable crates for extension developers.

## Phase 0: Outline & Research

1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - All technical decisions are clear from specification and input
   - Rust ecosystem patterns for CLI applications well-established
   - Distributed system synchronization patterns well-documented

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   ```
   Task: "Research Rust workspace best practices for CLI applications"
   Task: "Find best practices for clap CLI design patterns and Git-like UX"
   Task: "Research distributed system conflict resolution strategies"
   Task: "Find patterns for TOML configuration hierarchy in Rust"
   Task: "Research filesystem storage formats for structured data"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with architecture decisions and patterns

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts

*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - Issue: ID, title, description, status, assignees, labels, timestamps
   - User: Identity, authentication, team memberships, roles
   - Team: Name, members, permissions, project access
   - Project: Configuration, issues, team assignments, remotes
   - Label: Name, color, description for categorization
   - Remote: URL, protocol, sync state, authentication
   - Config: Global/local hierarchy, TOML format, validation

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - CLI command contracts for each `odi` subcommand
   - Crate interface contracts between `odi-*` libraries
   - Data format contracts for filesystem storage
   - Network protocol contracts for remote sync
   - Output contracts for JSON/human-readable formats

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - CLI command interface tests (input/output validation)
   - Crate API boundary tests (cross-crate communication)
   - Data serialization/deserialization tests
   - Configuration loading and validation tests
   - Tests MUST fail (no implementation yet)

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - `odi init` initialization flow integration test
   - Issue lifecycle (create/assign/update) integration test
   - Remote sync with conflict resolution integration test
   - Configuration hierarchy loading integration test
   - Git integration detection integration test

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run `.specify/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh copilot`
   - Add Rust workspace context and crate architecture
   - Include CLI patterns and distributed system knowledge
   - Update recent changes (keep last 3)
   - Keep under 150 lines for token efficiency

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, agent-specific file

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs (contracts, data model, quickstart)
- Each CLI command → contract test task [P]
- Each crate interface → contract test task [P]
- Each entity → model creation task [P]
- Each user story → integration test task
- Implementation tasks to make tests pass

**Ordering Strategy**:
- TDD order: Tests before implementation
- Dependency order: Core models → Services → CLI → Integration
- Workspace setup: Root Cargo.toml → Individual crates → Binary
- Mark [P] for parallel execution (different crates/independent files)

**Estimated Output**: 35-40 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| N/A | All constitutional requirements satisfied | N/A |

## Progress Tracking
*This checklist is updated during execution flow*
