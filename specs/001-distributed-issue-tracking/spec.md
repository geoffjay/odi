# Feature Specification: Distributed Issue Tracking System

**Feature Branch**: `001-distributed-issue-tracking`  
**Created**: 2025-09-28  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "build a distributed issue tracking system that functions similarly to git. users would initialize issue tracking for a local project using `odi init` and then continue to use `odi` commands for performing any and all issue tracking tasks, for example assigning an owner to an issue, assigning and adding authors, creating projects that can be used, assigning users to teams, adding and assigning labels, etc. the `odi` command should check if version control is in use and if so associate projects with the repository. configuration will be necessary for the `odi` tool, this should retrieve from ~/.odiconfig first followed by ./.odi/config and should use toml as the configuration language. similarly to git the ssh and https protocols should be supported for creating and updating a remote, which others can then update a local from. while odi is similar in concept to git, it will not be necessary to be able to create branches or perform tasks like rebasing. merging a remote into a local, and a local into a remote, will be necessary and instead of managing branches will attempt to resolve changes, if there are conflicts the user will be required to resolve them themselves."

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
A development team wants to track issues and collaborate on project management in a distributed manner, similar to how they use Git for source code. Team members can work offline, sync changes when connected, and have full local copies of issue data. The system integrates seamlessly with existing Git repositories while providing comprehensive issue management capabilities.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a new project directory, **When** a developer runs `odi init`, **Then** the system creates local issue tracking infrastructure and detects any existing Git repository association.

2. **Given** an initialized ODI project, **When** a user creates an issue with `odi issue create "Bug in login system"`, **Then** the issue is stored locally with a unique identifier and can be managed through subsequent commands.

3. **Given** two team members with local ODI repositories, **When** one member adds a remote with `odi remote add origin https://issues.example.com/project.git`, **Then** both can sync their issue data bidirectionally while resolving conflicts when necessary.

4. **Given** an ODI project with existing issues, **When** a user assigns an issue to a team member with `odi issue assign #123 @john`, **Then** the assignment is recorded locally and can be synchronized with remote repositories.

5. **Given** configuration files exist at both global (`~/.odiconfig`) and local (`./.odi/config`) levels, **When** the ODI system loads configuration, **Then** it applies global settings first, then overrides with local project-specific settings using TOML format.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when merging remote changes conflicts with local issue modifications?
- How does the system handle offline operation and later synchronization?
- What occurs when Git repository associations change or are removed?
- How are user identities and permissions managed across distributed instances?

## Requirements

- **FR-011**: System MUST track user roles and permissions within projects

#### Configuration Management
- **FR-012**: System MUST load configuration from `~/.odiconfig` (global) first
- **FR-013**: System MUST override global config with `./.odi/config` (local) settings
- **FR-014**: System MUST use TOML format for all configuration files
- **FR-015**: System MUST validate configuration syntax and provide clear error messages

#### Distributed Synchronization
- **FR-016**: System MUST support adding remote repositories via SSH and HTTPS protocols
- **FR-017**: System MUST enable pulling changes from remote repositories
- **FR-018**: System MUST enable pushing local changes to remote repositories
- **FR-019**: System MUST detect and handle merge conflicts during synchronization
- **FR-020**: System MUST require user intervention for conflict resolution
- **FR-021**: System MUST maintain data integrity during distributed operations

#### Git Integration
- **FR-022**: System MUST detect existing Git repositories during initialization
- **FR-023**: System MUST associate issue tracking with Git repository metadata when available
- **FR-024**: System MUST respect Git ignore patterns for ODI-specific files
- **FR-025**: System MUST provide commands to link issues with Git commits or branches

### Key Entities

- **Issue**: Core tracking unit with ID, title, description, status, assignees, labels, timestamps, and Git associations
- **User**: Individual with identity, authentication credentials, team memberships, and role assignments
- **Team**: Group of users with shared permissions and project access
- **Project**: Container for related issues with configuration, team assignments, and remote associations
- **Label**: Categorization tag with name, color, and description for issue organization
- **Remote**: External repository connection with protocol (SSH/HTTPS), URL, and synchronization state
- **Config**: Settings hierarchy with global and local scopes, TOML format, and validation rules
