# Phase 0: Research & Architecture Decisions

**Prerequisites**: plan.md technical context analysis
**Scope**: Resolve architecture decisions for Rust workspace CLI application

## Research Tasks Completed

### 1. Rust Workspace Best Practices for CLI Applications

**Decision**: Multi-crate workspace with binary + library separation
**Rationale**: 
- Enables code reuse across multiple binaries and external consumers
- Provides clear separation of concerns (CLI logic vs domain logic vs infrastructure)  
- Supports incremental compilation and testing of individual components
- Follows Rust ecosystem patterns used by Git, Cargo, and other CLI tools

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Single crate with modules: Rejected due to poor extensibility for external developers
- Separate repositories: Rejected due to version synchronization complexity

### 2. Clap CLI Design Patterns and Git-like UX

**Decision**: Subcommand-based architecture with clap derive macros
**Rationale**:
- Git-familiar command structure (`odi init`, `odi issue create`, `odi remote add`)
- Type-safe argument parsing with compile-time validation
- Automatic help generation and shell completion support
- Consistent error messages and validation patterns

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Builder pattern clap: Rejected due to verbosity and maintenance overhead
- Custom argument parsing: Rejected due to reinventing well-tested solutions

### 3. Distributed System Conflict Resolution Strategies

**Decision**: Three-way merge with manual conflict resolution (Git-like)
**Rationale**:
- Users already familiar with Git conflict resolution workflows
- Preserves data integrity by requiring explicit user decisions
- Supports complex conflict scenarios without data loss
- Enables offline-first operation with eventual consistency

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Automatic merge strategies: Rejected due to potential data loss in edge cases
- Last-writer-wins: Rejected due to loss of user work and poor collaboration experience
- Operational transforms: Rejected due to implementation complexity for this use case

### 4. TOML Configuration Hierarchy in Rust

**Decision**: Layered configuration with serde and config crate
**Rationale**:
- Native TOML support with type-safe deserialization
- Clear precedence rules: CLI args → local config → global config → defaults
- Validation at load time with helpful error messages
- Environment variable override support for CI/deployment scenarios

**Alternatives Considered**:
- JSON configuration: Rejected due to lack of comments and less human-friendly syntax
- YAML configuration: Rejected due to indentation sensitivity and security concerns
- Custom format: Rejected due to user learning curve and tooling limitations

### 5. Filesystem Storage Formats for Structured Data

**Decision**: TOML for metadata, JSON for bulk data with compression
**Rationale**:
- TOML for human-readable configuration and small metadata files
- JSON for structured data with efficient parsing and cross-language compatibility
- Optional compression (gzip) for large datasets to reduce storage overhead
- Atomic file operations with temporary files and rename for consistency

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Binary formats (protobuf/msgpack): Rejected due to debugging difficulty and tooling requirements
- SQLite embedded database: Rejected due to dependency complexity and file locking issues
- Pure JSON: Rejected due to lack of comments for configuration files

## Architecture Decisions Summary

### Crate Structure
```
odi/                    # Binary crate - CLI entry point and command routing
odi-core/              # Domain logic - entities, business rules, validation  
odi-fs/                # Filesystem operations - storage, config, Git integration
odi-net/               # Network operations - protocols, sync, authentication
```

### Data Storage Strategy
```
.odi/
├── config.toml        # Local project configuration
├── issues/            # Individual issue files (JSON)
├── projects.toml      # Project metadata and settings  
├── users.toml         # User and team definitions
├── remotes.toml       # Remote repository configuration
└── state/             # Synchronization state and locks
```

### CLI Command Architecture
```
odi
├── init              # Initialize new ODI repository
├── issue             # Issue management subcommands
│   ├── create        # Create new issue
│   ├── assign        # Assign issue to user/team
│   ├── label         # Add/remove labels
│   └── list          # List and filter issues
├── remote            # Remote repository management
│   ├── add           # Add remote repository
│   ├── push          # Push changes to remote
│   └── pull          # Pull changes from remote
├── team              # Team management
│   ├── create        # Create new team
│   └── add           # Add user to team
└── config            # Configuration management
    ├── get           # Get configuration value
    └── set           # Set configuration value
```

### Error Handling Strategy
- Result-based error propagation with custom error types
- User-friendly error messages with actionable suggestions
- Detailed error context for debugging without exposing internals
- Consistent exit codes following Unix conventions

### Performance Considerations
- Lazy loading of large datasets (issues, history)
- Incremental synchronization to minimize network overhead  
- Memory-mapped files for large read operations
- Background compression of historical data

### Security & Authentication
- SSH key-based authentication for SSH protocol
- OAuth/token-based authentication for HTTPS protocol
- Local credential storage with OS keyring integration
- Permission model based on Git repository access patterns

**Research Phase Complete**: All architecture decisions documented with rationale and alternatives. Ready for Phase 1 design and contract generation.
