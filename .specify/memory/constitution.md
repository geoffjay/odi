# ODI Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Test-Driven Development (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
Tests MUST be written before implementation code. All code changes MUST follow the Red-Green-Refactor cycle: write failing tests, implement minimal code to pass, then refactor. Contract tests are required for all APIs and module interfaces. Integration tests MUST cover cross-component communication and data flow. No feature is complete without comprehensive test coverage including unit, integration, and contract tests.

**Rationale**: Ensures reliability, prevents regressions, and enables confident refactoring while maintaining system integrity.

### II. Code Quality Standards
All code MUST pass automated quality gates including linting, formatting, and static analysis. Code MUST be self-documenting with clear naming conventions and minimal comments. Complex logic MUST include explanatory comments. Dead code and unused dependencies MUST be removed. Code review is mandatory for all changes with focus on maintainability, readability, and adherence to established patterns.

**Rationale**: Maintains long-term codebase health, reduces technical debt, and ensures consistent developer experience across the project.

### III. User Experience Consistency
All user interfaces MUST follow established design patterns and interaction models. CLI tools MUST use consistent argument patterns, output formats, and error messages. API responses MUST follow standard HTTP codes and consistent JSON structure. Documentation MUST be user-centric with clear examples and troubleshooting guides. Error messages MUST be actionable and user-friendly.

**Rationale**: Reduces learning curve, improves adoption, and creates predictable user interactions across all project components.

### IV. Performance Requirements
All features MUST meet defined performance benchmarks before release. API endpoints MUST respond within 200ms for typical operations. Memory usage MUST be tracked and optimized to prevent leaks. Database queries MUST be optimized and reviewed for N+1 problems. Performance regression testing is required for all changes affecting critical paths.

**Rationale**: Ensures scalable and responsive system that meets user expectations and can handle production workloads effectively.

### V. Specification-Driven Development
All features MUST start with a complete specification following the template structure. Implementation plans MUST be reviewed and approved before coding begins. No implementation details should appear in specifications - focus on user requirements and business value. All specifications MUST include testable acceptance criteria and clear success metrics.

**Rationale**: Ensures clear requirements, prevents scope creep, and enables proper planning and validation of features.

## Performance Standards

**Response Time Requirements**:
- API endpoints: <200ms p95 latency for standard operations
- CLI commands: <2s for typical operations, <10s for complex operations
- UI interactions: <100ms for local operations, <500ms for network operations

**Resource Constraints**:
- Memory usage: <100MB baseline, <500MB under normal load
- CPU usage: <25% average utilization under normal load
- Storage: Efficient data structures, no unnecessary data duplication

**Scalability Targets**:
- Support 1000+ concurrent API requests
- Handle 10,000+ specifications in a single project
- Process 100+ parallel task executions

## Development Workflow

**Code Review Process**:
- All changes require peer review before merge
- Reviews MUST verify constitutional compliance
- Security and performance impacts MUST be assessed
- Breaking changes require architecture team approval

**Quality Gates**:
- Automated tests MUST pass (100% for affected areas)
- Code coverage MUST maintain or improve existing levels
- Performance benchmarks MUST be met
- Documentation MUST be updated for user-facing changes

**Release Process**:
- Feature branches follow naming convention: `###-feature-name`
- Semantic versioning for all releases
- Release notes MUST include user impact and migration guides
- Staged rollout for major changes

## Governance

This constitution supersedes all other development practices and guidelines. All pull requests and code reviews MUST verify compliance with these principles. Any complexity that violates these principles MUST be justified in writing and approved by the project maintainers.

Constitutional amendments require:
1. Written proposal with rationale and impact analysis
2. Review period of minimum 7 days
3. Approval from project maintainers
4. Migration plan for existing code if applicable
5. Update to all dependent templates and documentation

For runtime development guidance, refer to agent-specific files in the repository root (e.g., `.github/copilot-instructions.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, etc.).
